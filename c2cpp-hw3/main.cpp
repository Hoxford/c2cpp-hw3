/* Basic problem:
 * Write a set of constructors for declaring and initializing
 * a graph. An edge will have a positive cost that is its distance. Have a
 * procedure that produces a randomly generated set of edges with positive
 * distances. Assume the graphs are undirected. The random graph procedure
 * should have edge density as a parameter and distance range as a parameter.
 * So a graph whose density is 0.1 would have 10% of its edges picked at random
 * and its edge distance would be selected at random from the distance range.
 * The procedure should run through all possible undirected edges, say (i,j)
 * and place the edge in the graph if a random probability calculation is less
 * than the density. Compute for a set of randomly generated graphs an average
 * shortest path.
 */

/* Turn in:
 * Printout of program, 200 words on what you learned, and output showing the average
 * path length calculation. Use densities: 20% and 40% on a graph of 50 nodes with
 * a distance range of 1.0 to 10.0. To get an average path length, compute the
 * 49 paths.
